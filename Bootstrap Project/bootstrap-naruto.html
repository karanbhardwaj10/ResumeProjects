            <p class="naruto-about-para">
                NARUTO is a Popular japanese Anime(Anime as in abbreviation for Animation) based upon an Orphan
                Hidden-leaf-village boy who all his childhood is treated like a freak by almost everyone due to his past
                which he knows nothing about ! Facing all of this treatment all day 24/7 he makes up his mind to become
                the Hokage(The village Head) so that people will acknowledge him ! Little did he know his destiny has
                something waayyy more for him then become just hokage of his village !<br>
                I thought of putting links to all the things that a newcomer wont understand about <a
                    href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Naruto_Uzumaki">Naruto</a> like this !
                but that would've just filled this with nothing but hyperlinks after every 3rd letter !<br> So if you're
                looking for an anime with a long but gripping story i'd say Naruto is the show for you ! I saw naruto
                when i was in 7th standard but after the staggering rise of DBZ popularity all the channels only showed
                DBZ or someother cartoons/anime shows
                In my early college days by friend recommended to start watching the show again from the scratch and
                after that i binged watched the whole Naruto(Naruto+Shippuden) in one month !!!!<br>
                Yes yes yes yes there are a lot of filler's which doesnt add much to the main story ! So yes if you're
                also thinking of watching the show and skipping the fillers ! Then you surely can it wont make any
                difference to your experience as a whole !
                You can watch Naruto on (9Anime or gogoanime or torrent) it's free there but if you're looking for an ad
                free thing and willing to spend money then Netflix will do the work. <br>
                In the show you'll get to see a lot of clans and i loved the Uchiha Clan ! <br>
                So in this blog under the topics section i'll be talking about the recent activites related to uchiha's
                and BORUTO (Continuation of Naruto).

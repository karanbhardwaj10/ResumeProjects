                Alright !! This is one of the most agreable topic there is when it comes to sasuke and his current
                status ! Since you've made your way to here i'mma assume you've watched Naruto and you would remember in
                a shippuden episode when naruto finally found sasuke ! they exchanged a few words and at the end sasuke
                was about to do Kirin (The lethal lightning Jutsu that he used on itachi) but orochimaru stopped him as
                it might've killed NARUTO !!!!! THE FREAKING MC OF THE SHOW !! From potentially killing naruto to now
                almost out of chakra at almost every fight or needing someone's help to complete hi duels ! This is the
                not the sasuke we knew in the whole NARUTO(NARUTO+SHIPPUDEN) .Sasuke had that kill or be killed vibe in
                him but now he's just like "Demmmnnn mehhnnnn i'mm Outta Chakra Yoooooooo ! eyii Naruto u help me or
                i'mma be toast " .
                i've got a lot of things to say about his nerf that makes no sense but i'll talk about 2 of them </p>

                        <p class="lead font-change"> At the end of shippuden sasuke and naruto both lost there arms due
                            to final blows from each ! Naruto got his arm back thanks to Hashirama's cell (The Man's a
                            Legend dude ! You can do almost anything in this series and link to hashirama and it'll
                            start
                            making sense ) but sasuke refused for the prosthetic arm as he felt guilty for all the
                            things he did in past that hurt the village and its people and now he wants to atone for his
                            sins ! That happened a long time ago ! like 8-12 years ago(in the series) . Now the village
                            faces a grave threat THE OTSUSTUKI and they're not planning to wipe out the village but the
                            entire Freakin PLANEETTTT !! Dont you think its time to get you're freaking arm
                            back and fight with you're full potential ?? and why whyyyy whyyyyyyyyyyyy they've given him
                            the sword ? the series is way past these things now (swords,shuriken,scrolls,smoke-bombs etc
                            basically all the ninja tools) i see no use of it ! i understand the writers perspective of
                            not making everything around naruto and sasuke in boruto as well but a character like sasuke
                            should be given the repect he deserves and not make him look like a backup or a sidekick to
                            anyone. </p>

                    <p style="font-family: cursive; margin-top: 25px;" class="lead"> The Sharingan and The
                        Rinnegan(rinneGONE for now) ! Two of the most powerfull eyes
                        in this series and they're using it as an anywhere-door .<br>
                        Remember the War-Arc ? They almost balanced the power gap b/w naruto and sasuke ! there were
                        clear things that only naruto can do and some things were there that only sasuke could do and
                        thats why they were called the dynamic duo as they both were not really dependent on each other
                        but in this series i feel like sasuke always fall behind when it comes to finishing the job
                        !<br>
                        Yes Yes i saw the Momoshiki's fight
                        with naruto and sasuke but the thing is it's the only time they actually used the powers of the
                        sharingan and rinnegan and that episode brings back a lot of memories about the show and it
                        showaed no matter how much you twist the story line or create new characters with insane amount
                        of powers !<br>
                        They just can not be as loveable as sasuke and naruto and even in that fight it was
                        sasuke who needed help in the end ! LIKE SERIOUSLY ?
                        A Man having
                        Sharingan/Mangekyou/Sharingan/Amaterasu/Tomoe/Chidori/Kirin/Susano/Rinnegan/Space-Time
                        Dojutsu/Indra's Arrow etc etc
                        etc etc !<br>
                        ALL OF THIS and they make him do mostly a mere teleportation.
                        Again comes the argument of not making the series on sasuke and naruto but atleast show him
                        equall to naruto .

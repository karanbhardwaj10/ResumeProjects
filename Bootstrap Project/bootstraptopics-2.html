            One of the things i liked about the shippuden is that after the greate fight b/w sasuke and naruto
            Kishimoto(writer of the naruto and boruto ) he didnt do any random BS like furthur more feud b/w clans or
            the higher up about authority and how he didnt just straight away made naruto the hokage , instead he made
            kakashi the hokage which is still a question that out of all the people why he made kakashi the hokage as he
            was least interested and
            there were many people who were qualified enough for that position ,for ex. - Shikamaru .<br>
            ALL of this is shown in boruto and i think that instead of boruto they should've made the War-Arc a bit more
            detailed and showed history of characters and there powers which we've only heard of ,Ex- The White-Fang of
            konoha i.e Sakumo Hatake or Minato's full fighting potential or intense fights b/w senju and uchiha clan .
            i dont know if there was a need of boruto series in the first place , it kinda hampers the legacy of the
            naruto
            Then again i am just another a person with a opinion .<br> Ok so the boruto had a rough start i saw a lot of
            reactions and They
            thought of the show as boring but after a certain episodes the show has picked up his aura ! I see the show
            is not all about some big chakra attacks ! basically not everyone is building up chakra and then suddenly
            releasing it in some sort of kame-hame-ha !<br>
            It is focusing on more of simple fist-fights (Taijutsu) which i saw lacking in the final episodes of
            shippuden<br>
            Till this point in boruto i dont think the show is complete BS and it's only improving from each
            episode .<br>
            In this Blog i'll talking about the 1 thing that i liked the mooooossssssssst in current boruto that i thought was lacking in the
            final episodes of shippuden.

                        Boruto: Naruto Next Generations anime has perhaps peaked with Episode 217, as fans got to see
                        the much-awaited Baryon Mode in action. The episode had a lot to offer, although the upcoming
                        episodes should have more in store.<br>

                        Those following the Boruto manga already knew of the Baryon Mode a few months ago. However,
                        seeing it in action was a visual treat for
                        Although Boruto occasionally treats fans to their favorite Hokage throwing hands, the Naruto vs
                        Isshiki fight was extraordinary in every way. Overall, Episode 217 was fairly dense in terms of
                        material.<br>

                        There is a lot to be said about the latest episode of the Boruto. The episode is based on manga
                        chapters that show the return of the OG Masashi Kishimoto at the helm of the manga storyline.
                        Sadly, the first thing he did was send Kurama to his grave.
                        Episode 217 had a lot more in store in addition to Baryon Mode Naruto taking on Isshiki.
                        Observant fans noticed the tribute this episode paid to the original Naruto anime.<br>

                        The taijutsu moves Naruto used on Isshiki are the same as those on Sasuke to prevent him from
                        deserting Konoha at the Final Valley.
                        Apart from this, it also shows how far Kawaki is willing to go for the Seventh Hokage, as he
                        sees the difference between Naruto and Jigen as a father figure more clearly. The episode ends
                        with a resolute Kawaki ready to take down the strongest Otsutsuki in the show yet.<br>

                        Those who have read the manga are already aware of the incredible powers Kawaki shows in this
                        fight and how he ultimately manages to neutralize the threat.<br>

                        Although Episode 217 of Boruto took the community by storm, the upcoming episodes will be
                        heartbreakingly sad with some unexpected developments. However, fans will be able to move past
                        it, as the anime has reached the most exciting stage of the story.<br>
